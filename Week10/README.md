#Week 10 Overview#

## Applied Text Mining: Social Media ##

This week we will introduce applied text mining by using social media, which is a form of data that
is constructed by users and either distributed to others or publicly
released. Popular examples of this type of data include emails, tweets,
and web pages. These types of data can be accessed either via build-in
Python libraries, public APIs, or simple web scraping. Specifically,
this week you will learn how to
authenticate to twitter to enable searching the twitter data stream. Finally, we introduce the concept of topic modeling, which
is an unsupervised learning approach to quantifying the topics, or
concepts, that make up different documents within a corpus.

### Objectives ###

#####By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:######

- Understand how to use OAUTH to authenticate an application
- Understand how to parse and classify twitter data
- Understand the basic concepts of topic modeling
- Be able to leverage these concepts within a Python application.
