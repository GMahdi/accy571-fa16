# Week 5 Lesson 1 #

## Introduction to Linear Regression ##

In this lesson you will learn how to perform basic linear regression by
using Python, which is one of the simplest techniques to construct a
predictive model from a data set.

### Objectives ###
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Understand the basic concepts of simple linear regression.
- Understand how to construct a linear model for a data set in Python by using the `statsmopdel` library.
- Understand how to construct a linear model for a data set in Python by using the `scikit_learn` library.

### Time Estimate###

Approximately 2 hours.

### Readings ####

_Course Notebook_
- Explore the course [Introduction to Regression][intro2regress] IPython Notebook on the course JupyterHub server.

_Other Material_
- Read through Section 3 of [Chapter 7, Linear Regression][blr]

#### *Optional Additional Readings*####

- Notes on [Linear Regression](http://people.duke.edu/%7Ernau/Notes_on_linear_regression_analysis--Robert_Nau.pdf)
