#Week 15: Overview#

## Advanced Machine Learning ##

This week we introduce advanced concepts in machine learning. First, we introduce Spark machine learning, which is a powerful way to apply machine learning techniques that we learned earlier in this course to large data sets. Second, we introduce deep learning. Deep learning has become an incredibly popular form of machine learning that generally leveraged some type of neural network to learn from data in order to make predictions. While neural networks have been around for some time, deep learning is fairly new, and has found applications in many areas,
especially image processing and natural language processing. In the one
lesson for this week, we will introduce neural networks and deep
learning, as well as provide additional resources for future study.

### Objectives ###

#####By the end of this lesson, you should accomplish the following learning objectives:######

- Understand how to use Spark MLlib
- Understand the basic concepts of a neural network
- Understand the basic tenets of deep learning 
- Be able to apply deep learning by using Python
