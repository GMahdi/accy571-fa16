# Week 9 Overview #
## Introduction to Text Analysis ##

This week you will start applying your new machine learning skills to
real world problems. This week we start this process by learning about
text analysis. First, we need to review the process by which textual
data is converted into numerical data that can be processed by a
computer. Along with this are a number of new concepts that focus on
manipulating these data to generate improved machine learning
predictions. Finally, we will apply machine learning algorithms
including classification to text data.

### Objectives ###

#####By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:######

- Understand the basic concepts of tokenizing a text document including
word counts, bag of words, stop words, and TF-IDF
- Understand the basic principles of text classification, including for
sentiment analysis.
