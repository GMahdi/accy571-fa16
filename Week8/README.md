#Week 8 Overview#

## Machine Learning ##

This week you will build on previous lessons to learn about outlier detection, as well as a number of practical concepts that can improve both the efficacy and performance of a machine learning technique. Anomaly detection is a rich field that focuses on
detecting data that do not follow previously established rules or
expectations. Finally, we will introduce a number of concepts that be
used to improve either how well an algorithm works or its execution
efficiency (or both).

### Objectives ###

#####By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:######

- Understand the basic principles of anomaly detection and the different
areas in which this technique is applied.
- Understand how to apply practical concepts such as feature scaling,
feature selection, cross-validation, and grid search to improve the
performance of a machine learning technique.
